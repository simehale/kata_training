##1. Convert string to camel case
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

Examples
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"


##2. Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"
